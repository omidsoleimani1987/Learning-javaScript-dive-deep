then ctrl + shift + P , then find eslint, then enable ESLint

make the npm package : npm init

install it for our project with npm : npm install --save-dev eslint 
then
    again ctrl + shift + P , then choose create eslint configuration

Configuring ESLint
ESLint offers a lot of different options so that you can really fine-tune it exactly to your requirements.

You can set up your own rules from the ground up (basically what we started doing in the lectures) but you can also use presets and pre-configured rulesets.

To fully understand all options you can configure in .eslintrc.json, this part of the official docs should be helpful: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring

To explore all available rules and what they mean, explore this part of the official docs: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/

Want to use a preset? Here you go: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=eslint-config (just click on one of the results and follow the instructions provided there)

Also check out the docs in general: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started
