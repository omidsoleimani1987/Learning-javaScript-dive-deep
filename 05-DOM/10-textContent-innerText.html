?) textContent

    The textContent property sets or returns the text content of the specified node, and all its descendants. remember that this property returns the text of all child nodes as well.

    const header = document.querySelector('header');
    header.textContent;
    ! output: "↵      title is here↵      small title↵    "

    If you set the textContent property, any child nodes are removed and replaced by a single Text node containing the specified string.

    * Note: This property is similar to the 'innerText' property, however there are some differences:
        - textContent returns the text content of all elements, while innerText returns the content of all elements, except for <script> and <style> elements.
        - innerText will not return the text of elements that are hidden with CSS (textContent will).

?) innerText

    The innerText property sets or returns the text content of the specified node, and all its descendants.

    If you set the innerText property, any child nodes are removed and replaced by a single Text node containing the specified string.

    header.textContent;
    ! output: "title is here↵small title"
