/*
iterables:
    Objects that implement the “iterable” protocol and have an @@iterator method (i.e. Symbol.iterator)
    objects that we can use the for of loop

Not every iterable is an array! Other iterables are for example: NodeList, String, Map, Set

Array-like:
    objects that have a length property and use indexes to access items

Not every array-like object is an array. other array-likes are for example :  NodeList, String
